This configuration adds some extensions and customizations:

- `broot.nvim` for files search (fzf can be used with `<Space>ff`).
- `numb.nvim` to preview lines when written in the command window.
- gitui keymaps (instead of lazygit ones).
- `<C-x>` to close buffer, `<C-q>` to close window and focus.nvim:
  - `<C-.>` to enable window autoresize (disabled by default).
  - `<C-,>` to disable window autoresize (disabled by default).
  - `<C-h/j/k/l>` to move to window in direction or create it if it does not
    exist.
  - `<C-m>` to maximize/set equal size of windows.
  - `<C-:>` to autoresize by golden ratio (default).
  Per-tab buffers with scope.nvim

by directory and extension.
